= Multiport Ethernet Echo
:docinfo:
[preface]

The multiport example application is a example of packet processing built on Twister API which also takes advantage of more than one ethernet port.

== Overview
The multiport example application performs Layer 2 forwarding for each packet that is received on the ports. All the other fields in the packets remain the same - only the MAC addresses are affected as follows:

* The source MAC address is replaced by the TX_PORT MAC address
* The destination MAC address is replaced by the Source MAC address of the received packet

== Compiling and Running the Application
Build the application using the following command:
--------------------------------------
make
--------------------------------------
To run the application in linuxapp environment
--------------------------------------
./MULTI_ECHO
--------------------------------------
