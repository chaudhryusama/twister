This doxygen doc is latest with all membuf and struct shown and function definition parameters,
but it does not include the if conditions which we used to improve the udp_echo_ and also the event loop amendement which including strings for engines. change the timer handler logic too because we dont need now sockfd etc.

There are only three folders here because we dont want all header to be shown at doxygen. There is a backup placed for all folders in one
directory back. LOOK FOR THAT
